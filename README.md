### üì¶ What's Included

1. **WebSocket Server** (`main.py`)  
   Receives events from Minecraft Education Edition via WebSocket and logs them to a timestamped JSON file in the `/data` folder.

2. **Data Science Lab** (`lab.py`)  
   A Tkinter desktop app that loads and analyzes the captured event data:
   - Total distance walked
   - Average chat message length
   - Word frequency histograms
   - Heatmap of player movement (X/Z grid)
   - Auto-refreshes every 60 seconds after file selection
   - Quit button included

3. **Live Player Monitor** (`monitor.py`)  
   A lightweight Tkinter tool that:
   - Monitors a selected event file
   - Displays who‚Äôs joined and their current position
   - Updates every 2 seconds

4. **AI-Powered Assessment** (`assessment.py`)  
   A script that connects to Azure AI to analyze player behavior and provide insights:
   - Requires an Azure API key and endpoint
   - Generates advanced analytics

---

### üõ† Setup

#### ‚úÖ Requirements

Install these via pip (preferably in a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install websockets matplotlib azure-ai-textanalytics
```

You also need:

- Python 3.7+
- Minecraft Education Edition (on another device on the same network)
- `allowDebugging=true` in Minecraft settings
- Azure AI API key and endpoint (see below)

#### üêç Activate venv (if using one)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

#### üîë Azure AI Setup

To use `assessment.py`, you need an Azure AI API key and endpoint:

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Create a new resource for "Cognitive Services" or "Text Analytics."
3. Copy the **API Key** and **Endpoint** from the resource's "Keys and Endpoint" section.
4. Set these as environment variables in your system:

  ```bash
  export AZURE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  export AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://your_endpoint_here
  ```

  On Windows, use:

  ```cmd
  set AZURE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  set AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://your_endpoint_here
  ```

### üöÄ Running the Server

```bash
python run.py
```

This script will activate the virtual environment (if configured) and start the WebSocket server.

- Listens on port `19131`
- Creates a new JSON file like `events_2025-03-28T10-05-22.json` in `/data`
- Logs: PlayerJoin, PlayerLeave, PlayerMessage, PlayerTransform, BlockPlaced

---

### üß™ Launch the Data Lab

```bash
python lab.py
```

- Click **"Load Log File"** and choose a `.json` event file from `/data`
- Click **"Run Analysis"** or wait for the app to refresh every 60 seconds
- Use **"Quit"** to exit

---

### üëÄ Use the Live Player Monitor

```bash
python monitor.py
```

- Select the same JSON file
- See a live display of:
  - Players who joined
  - Their latest known X/Y/Z positions
- Updates every 2 seconds

---

### ü§ñ Run the AI Assessment

```bash
python assessment.py
```

- Prompts the user to input assessment criteria (e.g., minimum engagement score, sentiment thresholds).
- Requires a `.json` event file from `/data`.
- Compares player data against the provided criteria.
- Outputs results to the console or saves them to a new file in `/data`.

---

### üóÉ Output Example

Event data looks like:

```json
{
  "event": "PlayerTransform",
  "body": {
    "player": {
      "name": "JustinE",
      "position": { "x": -45.1, "y": 73.6, "z": 66.2 }
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-03-28T10:18:30.340650",
  "client_ip": "192.168.1.10"
}
```

AI assessment output example:

```json
{
  "player": "JustinE",
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "engagement_score": 85
}
```
